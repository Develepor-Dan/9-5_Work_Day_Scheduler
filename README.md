# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
Have you wanted to have a daily scheduler for a typical 9am to 5pm work day. 

This calender applocation allows you to write events for each hour and save them. 

This application displays the current day at the top of the calender, as you scroll down, you will be presented with color-coded time blocks. Grey represents past, red represents the current hour, and green represents a future hour block. Once you click on a time block, you can enter an event and click the save icon on the right which will save your event into your local storage so the event will persist once you refresh the page.
